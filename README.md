### Problem Statement 

People love to share recipes and the joys of cooking among friends and family, but especially in these days where it is 
difficult to get parties in the same room, many people would love a new way to cook together. Others may be looking to 
make new friends through their favorite activity. Others yet are casual bakers and cooks, but need a good reminder or 
excuse to give a new recipe a try.

There are some recipe sharing apps in existence, where users can share photos and reviews, but few allow direct and 
private sharing among parties. These apps that have private sharing cost a premium. There is no app out there that not 
only allows for the input, scaling, sharing, and reviewing of recipes, but also turns cooking and baking into a social 
media where we can connect with friends and family, old and new.

Recipe Party is looking to change this. Parties may be hosted, in which the host invites friends, uploads a recipe for 
the group to try, picks a date or time frame, and the party reconvenes to share reviews and photos. Don’t have a recipe? 
Users can easily submit their recipes publicly so you can choose from other groups’ tested and approved dishes. Does the 
recipe call for gram measurements, but you don’t have a food scale? Or is the yield far too much? Recipes can easily be 
converted and scaled. Recipe Party is free to use, so anyone can keep their trial runs and secret family recipes to 
themselves or among private groups. All recipes when uploaded to a party are private, and only the uploader may decide 
if they would like to share their recipe publicly. Send friend requests to other reviewers or recipe makers, and make 
new connections through your shared passion.
