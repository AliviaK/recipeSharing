### Problem Statement 

People love to share recipes and the joys of cooking among friends and family, but especially in these days when it is 
difficult to get parties in the same room, many people would love a new way to cook together. Others may be looking to 
make new friends through their favorite activity. Others yet are casual bakers and cooks, but need a good reminder or 
excuse to give a new recipe a try.

There are some recipe sharing apps in existence where users can share reviews, but few allow direct and 
private sharing among parties. These apps that have private sharing cost a premium. There is no app out there that not 
only allows for the input, sharing, and reviewing of recipes, but also turns cooking and baking into a social 
media where we can connect with friends and family, old and new.

Recipes Among Friends is looking to change this. Parties may be hosted, in which the host invites friends, uploads a 
recipe for the group to try, picks a date or time frame, and the party reconvenes to share reviews and photos. Don’t 
have a recipe? Users can easily submit their recipes publicly, so you can choose from other groups’ tested and approved 
dishes. Recipe Party is free to use, so anyone can keep their trial runs and secret family recipes to themselves or 
among private groups. All recipes when uploaded to a party are private, and only the uploader may decide if they would 
like to share their recipe publicly.
