# Weekly Reflections

### Week 1 
#### Week of 8/30: 4 hours

Tasks Accomplished:
+ Update IntelliJ IDEA
+ Write first draft of Independent Project problem statement
+ Create first user stories

Since this is my second time taking this course, I had much of the required software downloaded and configured, so this 
week was spent updating IntelliJ, reviewing Git/GitHub and the command line, reviewing the course site, and introducing 
myself to my classmates. I made some progress on the planning portion of my independent project, which included writing
my first draft of my problem statement and MVP, and writing some user stories. I had issues loading the quizzes for the
two activities this week.

### Week 2
#### Week of 9/6: 7 hours

Tasks Accomplished:
+ Create indie project repository
+ Begin project README
+ Create and begin user stories and project plan documentation
+ Download TogglTrack

This week I worked along with the videos to create my project repository in IntelliJ and GitHub. Although I don't have 
much of the documentation planned, I started by creating the README and laying out the structure, and created the user 
stories and project plan files, and inserted the stories and MVP drafts I'd written last week. I forgot exactly how much 
planning goes into a project before any code is written! I'm still thinking out the MVP because I don't want to get in 
way over my head with features, but I have a good idea of all that I want to create. I've been looking at other recipe 
apps out there to get ideas of features I'd like and how to set my app apart from the rest. I've also looked at some API
ideas, but not positive yet on what I'd like to use or how the screen or database design will go. I signed up for 
TogglTrack to keep a more accurate account of my time spent and will begin using it next week, because the time flies 
much faster than I can keep track of on my own.
