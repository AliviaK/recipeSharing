# Weekly Reflections

### Week 1 
#### Week of 8/30: 4 hours

Tasks Accomplished:
+ Update IntelliJ IDEA
+ Write first draft of Independent Project problem statement
+ Create first user stories

Since this is my second time taking this course, I had much of the required software downloaded and configured, so this 
week was spent updating IntelliJ, reviewing Git/GitHub and the command line, reviewing the course site, and introducing 
myself to my classmates. I made some progress on the planning portion of my independent project, which included writing
my first draft of my problem statement and MVP, and writing some user stories. I had issues loading the quizzes for the
two activities this week.

### Week 2
#### Week of 9/6: 7 hours

Tasks Accomplished:
+ Create indie project repository
+ Begin project README
+ Create and begin user stories and project plan documentation
+ Download TogglTrack

This week I worked along with the videos to create my project repository in IntelliJ and GitHub. Although I don't have 
much of the documentation planned, I started by creating the README and laying out the structure, and created the user 
stories and project plan files, and inserted the stories and MVP drafts I'd written last week. I forgot exactly how much 
planning goes into a project before any code is written! I'm still thinking out the MVP because I don't want to get in 
way over my head with features, but I have a good idea of all that I want to create. I've been looking at other recipe 
apps out there to get ideas of features I'd like and how to set my app apart from the rest. I've also looked at some API
ideas, but not positive yet on what I'd like to use or how the screen or database design will go. I signed up for 
TogglTrack to keep a more accurate account of my time spent and will begin using it next week, because the time flies 
much faster than I can keep track of on my own.

### Week 3
#### Week of 9/13: 6.5 hours

Tasks Accomplished:
+ Add Log4J2 & JUnit to project
+ Finish User Stories/MVP documentation
+ Begin project plan mapping
+ Begin screen design
+ Begin user flow

This week I spent several hours working to finish writing and sorting the user stories, and denoting which will be part
of the project MVP. After completing the weekly work regarding JUnit and Log4J2 I added the dependencies for both into 
the project pom.xml and added the log4j2.properties into the resources, and assured it was configured properly. I 
continued working on the plan mapping and began playing around with screen design and user flow, which I plan to 
complete early this coming week to complete my Checkpoint 1 requirements. On Sunday I started working on the screen 
design and completed a mockup of the homepage.

### Week 4
#### Week of 9/20: 6 hrs

Tasks Accomplished:
+ Create recipesAmongFriends database
+ Create User table and add fake data
+ Create UserDao
+ Configure Hibernate to User class & User table
+ Create SessionFactoryProvider
+ Get user info to show on basic user search jsp
+ Achieve full CRUD coverage with DAO
+ Set up test database schema

This week's first focus was to prepare for Checkpoint 1, which included finalizing my project plan, screen design, user
stories, MVP, and application flow. With the feedback I received I plan to revise my MVP to make sure it isn't too 
ambitious for the time I have left this semester, and select one big feature to focus on while marking some other
planned features as additional goals I will add if time permits. I will also continue to work on the designs for the 
other MVP screens before creating them, so I will be readjusting my project plan to reflect these changes. 
After submitting my Checkpoint 1 documentation I began working on the Hibernate configuration and created a User class,
a UserDao, a SessionFactoryProvider, and a hibernate.cfg.xml file. I then created the recipesAmongFriends database and 
its first table, the User table. I annotated the User class to connect to the User table in the database, and borrowing
the jsps and SearchUser class from the user search assignment I conducted a successful search of the fake data I plugged
into my table, and confirmed that the dao is working properly. I finished the week with creating a test database so that
I was no longer messing with the data in my regular schema. I achieved full CRUD coverage for User.

### Week 5
#### Week of 9/27: 

Tasks Accomplished:
+ Change Log4J2 output location
